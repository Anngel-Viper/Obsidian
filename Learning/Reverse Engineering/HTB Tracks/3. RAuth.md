This is a kind of new challenge, I found some of the things in the disassembly and decompilation through Ghidra but its not enough.
It was heavily obfuscated and couldn't be read properly
It was hard to determine where the checks are happening.
I tried reading from the strings but couldn't get anything.
So its time to take some help with it.

I tried googling for the solution but then I want to just check first how to deal with a rust binary.

So this is a rust binary and its very hard to complete this challenge
