This was a pretty new challenge for me, here I learnt that the python code can be byte compiled.
This gives it an extension of ==.pyc== .
This doesn't make it directly executable, this is done to make it harder to reverse engineer.
We still have to execute this with the interpreter.

Now, this was an obfuscation.
The target was : -
1. To de-compile the python byte code
2. Then read the code with dis.dis(func) which is dismantle the objects
3. Then retrieve the flag

This was a pretty straight forward reverse engineering question.

Got me a new insight.
