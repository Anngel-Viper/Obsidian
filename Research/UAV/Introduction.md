A UAV is a **specific type of aircraft** that flies without a human pilot onboard whereas a drone is a broader term that refers to any remotely operated autonomous vehicle and not just the aerial ones.

Mostly used in military, industrial, and research applications.

A single UAV can be remotely operated and can be leveraged to attack.

==Cyber attacks on UAV systems in general include Data transmission link attacks, GPS (Global Positioning System) Scam attack, authentication attacks such as Brute Force, attacks against source code vulnerabilities, and hardware port and protocol attacks.==
